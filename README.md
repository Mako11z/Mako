Mako: A Compiler for a Python-inspired C++ Language

Mako is a compiler for a new language that blends the readability of Python syntax with the power and performance of C++. It allows you to write code that is both easy to understand and highly efficient.

Features

Familiar Python-like syntax: Mako leverages familiar Python keywords and operators for control flow, variable declaration, and expressions.
C++ Code Generation: The compiler translates Mako code into optimized C++ code, allowing you to harness the performance benefits of C++.
Logical and Arithmetic Operations: Currently, Mako supports basic logical operators (and, or) and arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
Getting Started

Code snippet
int a = 5;
int b = 10;

a = a + b;

if (a > b and a < 20) {
    print("a is bigger and a is smaller than 20");
} else {
    print("false");
}

Why Mako?

Express Yourself Clearly: Mako leverages familiar Python keywords and operators for control flow, variable declaration, and expressions, making your code easy to read, write, and maintain.
Unleash C++'s Power: Under the hood, Mako translates your Mako code into optimized C++ code, giving you the unmatched performance and efficiency that C++ is renowned for.
Strike the Perfect Balance: Mako lets you focus on the logic and clarity of your Python-inspired code, while the compiler handles the intricacies of C++, ensuring you reap the benefits of both worlds.


Beyond the Basics (Future Development):

Mako is actively evolving, with plans to expand its capabilities:

Control Flow: Support for additional control flow statements like while loops, for loops, and various conditional constructs.
Function Power: Define and call functions just like you would in Python, harnessing the power of C++ functions for modularity.
Data Structures: Use rich data structures like arrays and objects to organize your code effectively, mirroring the ease of Python while maintaining C++'s efficiency.
Type Checking and Error Handling: Enhance code robustness with type checking and informative error messages, ensuring your code is well-structured and avoids runtime errors.
